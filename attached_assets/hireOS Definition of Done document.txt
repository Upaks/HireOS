🔢 Phase 1: MVP Delivery (Core Candidate Flow)
1. Hiring Intake Form → Auto Job Setup
* Description: Create a web-based intake form where internal managers can initiate hiring requests. The form must capture job title, role type (e.g., contractor/full-time), hiring urgency, skills/KPIs, and team context. Upon submission:

   * Triggers a call to GPT-4 (using the existing Job Description Generator) with input payload.

   * Returns a complete job description and suggested title, rendered on-screen.

   * Auto-generates a HiPeople assessment link tied to the job type.

   * All three outputs are saved to Replit DB, with timestamps and submitter ID.

   * Logs event details (duration, success/fail, preview string) to Replit Console for observability.

   * Displays results in a preview pane with "Approve & Post" CTA.

   * Input schema validation via Zod, with fallback error rendering in the UI.

      * Story Points: 6

      * Estimated Time: 4.5 hours

2. Job Description Approval + Posting Flow
         * Description: Build a minimal approval workflow interface. Once hiring stakeholders review the generated job description, they must be able to approve or reject it. On approval:

            * Job is posted to configured channels (LinkedIn, onlinejobs.ph), initially mocked via stub or dev-only API keys.

            * System logs post results (posted URL, platform ID, status code) into Replit DB.

            * A Slack webhook is triggered containing the job title, posting platform(s), and timestamp for traceability.

            * Retry-on-failure logic is added with capped retries (1 retry after 5s backoff).

               * Story Points: 4

               * Estimated Time: 3 hours

3. Applicant Handler + Assessment Delivery
                  * Description: Automate first-touch logic for incoming candidates. When an applicant submits their information:

                     * A 3-hour delay timer is set using Replit Cron (based on timestamp diff) before contact.

                     * After the delay, the system sends a branded email (via Replit email API) containing:

                        * A welcome message

                        * The job title

                        * The unique HiPeople assessment link for that role

                           * The DB logs the assessment delivery timestamp and link status.

                           * If "Express Review" is toggled on for the role, the 3-hour wait is bypassed entirely.

                              * Story Points: 5

                              * Estimated Time: 3 hours

4. Candidate Screener View
                                 * Description: Create a UI panel for hiring managers to evaluate candidate applications:

                                    * Automatically filters candidates with HiPeople scores above the 50th percentile.

                                    * Includes status indicators (e.g., Awaiting Interview, Talent Pool, Rejected).

                                    * UI buttons allow managers to take action: Reject, Talent Pool, or Invite to Interview.

                                    * Every action writes an audit entry to Replit DB with userID, timestamp, and decision.

                                       * Story Points: 6

5. Interview Scheduling Trigger

                                             * An automated email is sent with a pre-configured calendar scheduling link (e.g., Calendly or Airtable embed).

                                             * DB is updated to mark the candidate status as "Interview Scheduled."

                                             * Replit Console logs show success/failure and email metadata.

                                                * Story Points: 3

                                                   * Description: Interface to facilitate structured review of recorded interviews:

                                                      * One-way video interviews are embedded from secure platforms (e.g., Dropbox, YouTube unlisted).

                                                      * UI includes input fields for grading each question + overall comments.

                                                      * Submitted scores are saved to DB under the candidate’s profile for later viewing.

                                                      * Optional: auto-calculate average score and standardize to 100-point scale.

                                                         * Story Points: 4
