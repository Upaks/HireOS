✅ Section 1: Roadblocks
🔧 Primary Roadblock
Manual, fragmented hiring workflows slow down decision-making and lead to missed or delayed action on top candidates.
🔍 Specific Breakdown in the Workflow:
* Hiring manager submits a Hiring Assessment Form

* Job title, description, and HiPeople link must be manually created and reviewed

* Delays in stakeholder approval via Google Docs slow job posting

* Candidate applications come in across platforms (LinkedIn, onlinejobs.ph) with partial automation — unclear messaging bots running on onlinejobs.ph

* No centralized view of qualified candidates (HiPeople score >50th percentile)

* Interview scheduling and follow-ups require Slack nudges and manual Airtable filtering

* Final offers and rejections are ad-hoc, with no structured flow for the COO or HR to take action
          
🛠️ Systems or Infrastructure Gaps:
   * No centralized "hub" or Replit-native system for tracking job-to-offer lifecycle

   * Fragmented use of UseWhale SOPs, Airtable, Slack, and platform-specific bots

   * Job Description GPT exists but is not yet linked to trigger automation from form submissions

   * Unknown status of automation bots created by a former team member — no ownership or documentation

📉 Measurable Outcomes:
      * ~4+ day average delay from final interview to offer letter

      * ~50% of qualified candidates not reviewed within 48 hours

      * 5–10 Slack nudges required per hire to remind about posting, approvals, or scheduling

      * 3 hours of manual effort per candidate across job creation, messaging, and follow-ups


💡 Attempts Made Previously & Why They Didn’t Work:
         * Onlinejobs.ph bots and UseWhale SOPs used to automate parts of the flow — but the developer who built them left, leaving gaps in documentation and logic

         * Job Description GPT built and in use — but not yet wired to auto-generate and distribute descriptions

         * Slack reminders, Airtable filters, and Google Docs were used manually — but became overwhelming and unreliable at scale



⚠️ Cost of Inaction
            * Delayed job visibility reduces applicant pool and delays hiring for critical roles

            * High-quality candidates drop off due to lack of timely follow-ups

            * Hiring managers spend excessive time manually coordinating basic steps

            * Stakeholders (e.g. COO) lack visibility and structure to make fast hiring decisions

            * Inconsistent rejections harm candidate experience and company brand

            * Cannot scale hiring across 5–10 roles without operational gridlock



🧠 Project Impact Statement
This system will automate the entire candidate lifecycle from job intake to final offer or rejection.
               * Job descriptions, HiPeople links, and posting logic auto-generated

               * Qualified candidates surfaced and filtered automatically

               * Interview scheduling, reminders, and status updates handled without human bottlenecks

               * Offers sent with a single click by COO inside a structured approval view

               * Auto-rejects and polite messaging sent to non-qualified candidates

Recurring team pain — like Slack reminders, tab-hopping, and Airtable status updates — becomes fully systematized.


🔩 Replit-First Lens
Replit-native tools are sufficient for 90%+ of the system:
                  * Replit DB: Job data, candidate scoring, hiring status tracking

                  * Autoscale Repl: Frontend (Next.js) + backend logic

                  * Replit Cron: Scheduled reminders, assessment follow-ups, offer delays

                  * Console Logs: Centralized system error tracing

Escalation Triggers:
                     * Use Supabase only if scoring or role-based permissions require relational filters

                     * Use Make/n8n only if automation chains go beyond 3+ branches or 3rd-party handoffs

                     * Use Cursor if prompt chains or agentic grading logic becomes too complex for standard functions

🚧 Dependencies & Risks
                        * Platform Access: Unknown ownership of legacy bots on onlinejobs.ph

                        * Stakeholder Bandwidth: Delays in hiring manager review or COO decision may create gaps even if the system works

                        * Legacy Automations: Partial Make/zapier setups from ex-team member may create conflicts or confusion if not deprecated

                        * System Scale Risk: Replit DB or memory constraints if data grows unexpectedly fast (e.g. hundreds of applicants per role)



🧰 Tool Simplicity Principle
✅ Yes — Replit-first by default. Escalate to:
                           * Supabase only for relational queries, access control, or role-based visibility

                           * Make/n8n only if workflow logic exceeds 3+ external steps or has retry chains

                           * Cursor only if logic is better built with embedded agentic decision-making



✅ Section 3: Product Vision
🔓 Strategic Unlock
HireOS enables FirmOS to run a fully automated hiring system across both internal and customer roles, with only two required human inputs:
                              1. Initial Hiring Form submission

                              2. Review decision at key stages (screening and interview)

All other actions — job description generation, job posting, assessment follow-ups, interview scheduling, and offer delivery — are fully automated.
Decisions supported:
                                 * Pre-interview: Reject, Talent Pool, or Send Interview

                                 * Post-interview: Reject, Talent Pool, or Send Offer (with auto-email + contract link)



💡 Unique Differentiator
                                    * Supports both internal and customer-facing hiring pipelines

                                    * Allows both salaried and contractor positions with dynamic offer templates

                                    * Eliminates 10+ Slack/email/manual actions through Replit automation

                                    * Centralizes every step into a single UI flow with Slack + Copilot notification hooks

                                    * Creates structured logs and records for every decision, increasing accountability



🧱 Reusability & Modularity
                                       * Template engine supports multiple role-based offer letters

                                       * Same logic and decision layer can be reused for:

                                          * Future role-based onboarding

                                          * Vendor or partner intake flows

                                          * Promotion and internal mobility reviews

                                             * Flexible enough to support multi-client logic (internal vs customer teams) via flag or view switch



⚙️ Automation Maturity Level
Level 4 – Tool-Based AI Agent
                                                * GPT-based job generation

                                                * Replit Cron for scheduling follow-ups

                                                * Slack/API integrations for alerting and status updates

                                                * Decision logic handled via UI buttons mapped to backend triggers (no manual data entry)

	✅ Section 4: Replit Build Strategy
🏗️ Architecture Type
Single Repl MVP — combining frontend (Next.js + TypeScript), backend API logic, Replit DB, and Replit Cron in one deployable Repl.
                                                   * Goal: Fastest path to usable prototype with minimal overhead.

                                                   * Future-ready: Easy to modularize into separate Repls (e.g., split out cron logic or offer flow).



🚀 Deployment Type
                                                      * Autoscale Repl: For UI and API logic (scales automatically with usage)

                                                      * Replit Cron: Handles background workflows:

                                                         * Follow-up nudges

                                                         * Rejection delay timers

                                                         * Notification batching for internal + customer teams



🗃️ Data Storage Logic
Layer
	Tool
	Use Case
	Escalation Threshold
	Primary
	Replit DB
	Job records, candidate assessments, interview states, offer metadata
	Safe for <1K records, <50MB total, and non-relational reads
	Fallback
	Supabase
	Multi-role access, filtering by job/client/team, role-based dashboards
	Escalate if:
	                                                            * 

1K records


                                                            * Relational joins (e.g., job → candidates → offer)

                                                            * Internal vs customer auth separation

                                                            * Email-verification or login protection |

We'll build with Replit DB first, but structure read/write logic as functions so a Supabase swap is seamless when needed.


⚙️ Performance Optimizations
                                                               * Lazy-load GPT job generation and contract rendering modules

                                                               * Avoid blocking I/O on email or webhook calls (use async / background queues)

                                                               * Monitor RAM and startup time via Replit Console; consider Reserved VM if cron tasks grow



🔐 Session Management
                                                                  * Stateless JWT for internal user roles (COO, hiring managers)

                                                                  * Separate dashboard views for internal vs customer teams

                                                                  * Role-based visibility toggle via signed JWT claims or invite links



✉️ Sender Identity
                                                                     * All outbound emails (offers, rejections, reminders) will be sent from:
team@firmos.ai

                                                                     * This will be wired into Replit email send logic (or fallback SMTP service)

                                                                     * Optional: Add SendGrid or Resend for delivery observability (Phase 2+)

	✅ Section 5: Target Users
👤 Primary Personas
Role
	Description
	FirmOS Managers
	Any internal manager responsible for screening, grading, and interviewing candidates. Can initiate hiring and conduct 1st-round interviews.
	COO
	Conducts 2nd-round interviews (values-based), makes final decision to offer, reject, or talent pool.
	FirmOS Customers
	External managers who may:
	                                                                        * 
Conduct 1 or 2 rounds of interviews

                                                                        * Delegate screening to FirmOS

                                                                        * Use the system for viewing, interviewing, and decision-making on talent |

The system must support internal and external users, where internal FirmOS may act on behalf of customers (including running 1st-round interviews if needed).


⚠️ Daily Pain
Persona
	Frustration
	Managers (FirmOS or Customer)
	“I can’t tell who’s been screened already, or who I need to review. I waste time checking Airtable and pinging team members.”
	COO
	“I don’t know which candidates are ready for me. Offers and rejections are inconsistent.”
	Customers
	“I don’t have time to screen every applicant. I just want to see the top 3. I also don’t know who’s been contacted or scheduled.”
	

🧩 Secondary Stakeholders
Role
	Dependency
	HR / Compliance
	Needs to know when an offer has been accepted to trigger onboarding.
	Program Coordinators
	Monitor hiring volume, timeline, and health across multiple customer accounts.
	Operations / Client Success
	Want visibility into which roles are filled, stalled, or ready for action.
	

✨ Desired Transformation
Problem
	Transformation
	“Too many tools, not enough visibility”
	Single UI for screening, grading, and decision-making
	“Candidates get ignored or ghosted”
	Auto-rejections and follow-ups without needing Slack nudges
	“Approvals stall the pipeline”
	Actionable buttons at each stage: reject, invite, offer — all from one view
	“Customers want FirmOS to do more of the process”
	System supports FirmOS-led screening/interviews, with customer decision only at the end
	

🔐 Trust Threshold
This tool must:
                                                                           * Support role-based visibility (customers shouldn’t see internal data)

                                                                           * Be polished enough for external customer access

                                                                           * Never send an offer or rejection without a logged user decision

Offer emails and rejections will include sender identity and candidate tracking ID.

                                                                              * Auto-trigger onboarding email with:

                                                                                 * Welcome message

                                                                                 * Contract download link

                                                                                 * Onboarding checklist (via link or embedded)

                                                                                    * Status field auto-updates in Replit DB + optional Airtable sync

Internal onboarding team receives Slack ping to begin:
                                                                                       * Payroll entry

                                                                                       * Access provisioning

                                                                                       * Background check (if required)

🧨 Risk Monitoring (Replit Platform Limits)
Constraint
	Threshold
	Mitigation
	Memory Usage
	>7.5 GiB sustained
	Monitor Replit Console; offload batch jobs to second Repl
	File System Size
	>3 GiB
	Store assets externally (e.g., resumes/videos via GDrive)
	In-memory Object Size
	>512MB
	Paginate large Airtable/API reads
	Boot Time (Cold Starts)
	>10s
	Lazy-load heavy GPT logic, use Reserved VM if needed
	Module Error / Package Bloat
	Any failed npm install
	Audit and trim unused dependencies or isolate large logic to background Repl
	

⚠️ Platform & Third-Party Constraints
Tool
	Constraint
	Fallback Strategy
	onlinejobs.ph
	500 outbound messages per month (platform DM limit)
	Auto-throttle messages based on position priority, use platform email only for top-tier applicants, move rest to standard email outreach
	HiPeople
	Per-user or per-assessment rate limits (TBD)
	Add email queue + retry logic via Replit Cron; rotate assessment links if needed
	Slack API
	Rate limit: 1 message/sec/channel
	Batch messages + throttle in Cron queue
	

⛑️ Escalation Thresholds
System
	Escalate If...
	Fallback
	Supabase
	>1,000 records + filters or multi-role auth needed
	Use Supabase for analytics and permissioned dashboards
	Make.com
	>3 chained automations, or webhook dependency with external systems
	Use Make for multi-tool orchestration (e.g., Slack + email + GHL + LinkedIn)
	Reserved VM
	Interview UI or GPT job generation slows at scale
	Move heavy logic or UI to persistent VM
	Email Provider (Replit native)
	>200 daily emails or deliverability issues
	Switch to SendGrid/Resend for volume and delivery tracking
	Storage / File Uploads
	>50MB per video or resume
	Use external file links (Google Drive, Dropbox, YouTube unlisted)

                                                                                             * DB layer (Replit DB vs Supabase)

                                                                                             * Messaging rate-throttle mode

                                                                                             * Email provider

                                                                                                * Zero-Downtime Swaps:

                                                                                                   * All escalation logic modularized via service adapters

                                                                                                   * Escalation triggers monitored via telemetry (e.g., msg count/month, error retries)

                                                                                                      * Sync Layer (if Replit DB + Supabase coexist):

                                                                                                         * Cron sync daily for analytics or external dashboarding

⚙️ Trigger Inputs & System Response
Trigger Type
	Event
	System Behavior
	Fallback / Edge Handling
	Form Submission
	Hiring Assessment Form submitted
	Triggers GPT job description, generates assessment link, preps for approval
	Logs output to console and Slack; retry on GPT fail
	Manual Approval
	Stakeholder clicks "Approve Job Description"
	Posts job across platforms, notifies channel
	Re-queue if post fails; throttle to avoid API block
	Applicant Submission
	New candidate applies via form
	Waits 3 hours → sends HiPeople link + intro
	Skip delay if "Express Review" toggle active
	Assessment Completion
	Candidate finishes HiPeople
	Score stored, flagged if >50th percentile
	Retry if API not responsive; soft log failures
	UI Action: Send Interview
	Manager clicks invite
	Sends interview link + calendar
	Email retry logic + Slack confirmation
	UI Action: Send Offer
	COO or manager clicks offer
	Populates and sends email + contract link
	Logs to DB; alerts if offer fails
	UI Action: Reject
	Reject clicked at any stage
	Sends branded email, archives record
	Skips if already marked "Rejected"
	UI Action: Talent Pool
	Talent Pool clicked
	Sends light message, adds tag
	Skips email if already in pool
	Interview No-Show or Delay
	No booking in 72h
	Slack nudge + manager ping
	Re-queue up to 3x, escalate to COO
	No Decision Made
	Candidate stalled in status 5+ days
	Sends Slack summary & escalates to dashboard
	Optional auto-reject after timeout
	

🔄 Fallback Stack Use Criteria
Stack
	Use When
	n8n / Make.com
	Replit Cron cannot handle external webhook chaining (e.g. Slack + Airtable + Email) or error branching becomes complex
	Supabase
	Role-based dashboards, secure filtering, or real-time collaboration needed
	SendGrid / Resend
	Email volume >200/day or deliverability tracking required
	Cursor
	Advanced prompt chaining, interview score routing, or offer clause generation needed
	

🧠 LLM Involvement
Use Case
	Engine
	Prompt Safety
	Job Description Generation
	GPT-4 (existing FirmOS model)
	Deterministic inputs; retry on null
	Email Templating (Offer, Rejection)
	Replit logic (template fill)
	No LLM needed — structured template logic
	Auto-summarization (Optional Phase 2)
	GPT or Claude
	Under 85% confidence = hold for review
	All GPT logic must be idempotent (retry-safe) and promptlib-documented for audit.

✅ Section 11: Deployment Footprint


🌐 Environments
Environment
	Setup
	Purpose
	Development
	Local Replit or branch-linked Repl
	For active code changes and feature testing
	Staging
	Separate Repl or feature flag in main
	Used to test full workflow before production release (with mock data)
	Production
	Main Repl (Autoscale enabled)
	All live candidate + hiring flows; must be locked from experimental changes
	MVP uses a single Repl with env-based gating
 Phase 2 may split Staging and Production if customer-facing scale increases.


🚀 Release Mechanics
Mechanism
	Description
	Git commit-based deploys
	Code changes pushed to GitHub auto-deploy via Replit integration
	Feature flags
	Key logic (e.g. Slack alerts, Supabase sync, Offer Generator v2) is gated behind env flags
	Config via .env
	Role-based routing, DB toggle, onlinejobs.ph throttle count managed via .env
	

🛠️ Hotfix Capability
Method
	Description
	Push override
	Authorized users can push emergency fixes via Replit Console or commit
	Rollback Timer
	If new build fails >3x in 10 minutes, system auto-reverts to last stable commit
	Cron job disable switch
	Replit Cron flows can be suspended via .env (DISABLE_CRON=true) to stop retries or stuck flows immediately
	

🧯 Failover Plan
Risk
	Strategy
	Replit downtime
	Local CSV export triggered (for candidate + job backup); Slack alert to #hiring-ops
	Cold start stalls offer flow
	Move Offer logic to Reserved VM or isolate it in second Repl
	Supabase sync delay (if escalated)
	Logs queue in Replit DB and retries on next Cron tick
	Email provider outage
	Swap to fallback SMTP or Resend (template-based switch logic already modularized)

✅ Section 15: Risks & Mitigations


🧨 Risk Table
Risk
	Impact
	Likelihood
	Mitigation Strategy
	Replit DB limitations (scale, filters, joins)
	High if record count grows fast or filters become complex
	Medium
	Begin with Replit DB; modularize logic for easy Supabase migration after 1,000+ records or 3+ relational queries
	onlinejobs.ph 500 msg/month limit
	Could throttle applicant messaging, hurt candidate flow
	High
	Prioritize messages to top-tier candidates, queue others via email or fallback comms channel
	Slack / Email API rate limits
	Alerts could get delayed or fail silently
	Medium
	Add rate-limiting guards + batching logic in Cron flow
	Offer email fails (spam, delivery)
	Missed offers = lost candidates
	Low
	Track email logs + swap to SendGrid/Resend if delivery rate drops below 95%
	Manager inaction (e.g. no job approval)
	Delays candidate intake or hiring actions
	High
	Replit Cron escalations + dashboard “stuck” flag + Slack reminders
	LLM job description failure or hallucination
	Inaccurate postings could affect hiring quality
	Low
	Retry logic on empty GPT output, audit logs, and option for manual override
	Lack of user adoption
	System built but unused = ROI drop
	Medium
	Weekly Slack usage digest, product manager coaching, usage-based visibility for COO
	Video platform policy changes (e.g. YouTube unlisted rules)
	Could break one-way interview playback
	Low
	Store video links in a modular format; allow alternative upload paths in future builds
	Copilot/Customer access abuse or confusion
	Data visibility or workflow misuse
	Medium
	Role-based view enforcement with JWT-auth & environment-based access control

                                                                                                                  * audit logs

                                                                                                                  * confirmation messages

                                                                                                                  * alert fallbacks (Slack, Console, optional email)

❌ Explicitly Avoided / Not Needed
Tool
	Reason
	Firebase
	Adds auth/storage complexity; Supabase preferred fallback
	MongoDB, Postgres (manual)
	Adds infra burden; Replit DB → Supabase covers spectrum
	Airtable (write-side)
	Read-only sync only; all source-of-truth lives in Replit-native DB
	Heroku, Vercel, Netlify
	All deployment is via Replit Autoscale
	Zapier
	Replaced by Replit Cron or Make.com if necessary

✅ Section 18: Technical & Tool Constraints


💻 Core Environment Constraints (Replit Autoscale)
Constraint
	Value
	Notes
	RAM Limit
	8 GiB
	Sustained usage above 7.5 GiB requires either logic split or Reserved VM
	vCPUs
	4
	Avoid long-running compute tasks; break into async microflows
	File Storage
	50 GiB
	Includes node_modules, system logs, and temp uploads
	File System Size per File
	<250MB
	One-way videos must be externally hosted (YouTube, Drive, Dropbox)
	Network Bandwidth
	Shared pool
	Burst-safe but not CDN-grade — SSR must be performant
	

🚫 GPU Access
                                                                                                                           * Replit currently does not support GPU workloads

                                                                                                                           * AI work must be prompt-based (GPT, Claude), not model training or fine-tuned LLMs



⛔ Long-Polling or Streaming
                                                                                                                              * Avoid persistent long-poll (e.g., socket.io without server support)

                                                                                                                              * If real-time needed: escalate to WebSockets or use polling via Replit Cron



✅ UI & Code Standards
Area
	Requirement
	UI Stack
	Tailwind + shadcn/ui
	TypeScript Enforcement
	All user-facing components and backend handlers
	Interface Contracts
	Use Zod or TS interfaces for all input validation
	Component Rules
	Typed props, no any, minimal logic in views
	Form Behavior
	1-click submission; all async ops show loading + error fallback
	Mobile Responsiveness
	Required on all views; test at 375px width (iPhone baseline)
	

🚫 Tooling Restrictions
Tool
	Reason
	Firebase, MongoDB, Auth0
	Adds unnecessary auth complexity
	Zapier, Retool, Vercel
	Covered by Replit Cron, native deploy, and Make fallback
	Custom Analytics Engines
	Replit DB + Supabase views are sufficient for reporting
	Unstructured GPT outputs
	All LLM outputs must be wrapped in promptlib schema or parsed before display
	✅ Section 19: API Integration Needs


🔌 Internal APIs
API
	Purpose
	Auth Method
	Fallback Behavior
	Replit DB (native)

	Replit Cron
	Trigger timed workflows (rejections, reminders)
	N/A
	Retry missed jobs on next scheduled tick
	Promptlib (internal prompt wrapper)
	Call GPT for job title/description generation
	API key via .env
	If LLM fails or returns null: retry 3x, then fallback to manual review flag
	

🌐 External APIs

	If Slack fails → Console alert
	Email Provider (Replit SMTP → Resend)
	Send offers, rejections, interview links
	SMTP or API key
	Retry 3x with 5s backoff
	Log fail; flag offer as “unsent”
	Onlinejobs.ph (POST/DM)
	Post job listings + respond to applicants
	Cookie-based or token (manual key)

🧯 Retry Strategy (Global)
                                                                                                                                 * All third-party POSTs and GETs have built-in:

                                                                                                                                    * 3 retries

                                                                                                                                    * Exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 30s)

                                                                                                                                    * Final fallback flag → Slack alert or DB write with status: failed_external_call

✅ Section 20: UX/UI Guidelines


🧱 Component & Styling Standards
Area
	Guideline
	UI Framework
	All components use shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS utility classes
	Styling System
	Tailwind defaults extended for FirmOS brand: primary, secondary, accent
	Component Layout
	Mobile-first, grid-aligned, xl:2xl rounded corners, shadow-md, clear padding (p-4 minimum)
	Theme
	Light mode default; add dark mode toggle only if candidate-facing
	Responsive
	Must pass on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, iOS Safari, and Android Chrome at 375px
	

🧩 Component Rules
Rule
	Description
	Props must be typed
	Use Zod or TS interfaces for all props, especially async forms
	Avoid any type
	Use unknown + refine, or shape narrowing
	Error States
	All async buttons/forms show a fallback: spinner, error toast, or console fallback
	Loading Indicators
	Every async action (send offer, GPT call, submit grading) must show loading UI
	Forms
	Use react-hook-form or zodResolver with 1-click submit, inline validation errors
	Button Groups
	Decision actions (Reject / Offer / Talent Pool) grouped logically with confirmation prompt (optional Phase 2)
	

🧑‍💻 DX Enhancers
Area
	Rule
	Ghostwriter / AI Assist
	Component prop hints and TS interfaces should be AI-friendly (clear names, comments)
	Shared Library
	Reusable logic lives in /lib, components in /components
	API Routes
	Typed input/output using TS + api/route.ts pattern
	Promptlib Integration
	All GPT logic uses reusable generatePrompt() or equivalent wrapper
	State Management
	Avoid context unless necessary; use props-down, events-up pattern
	

✅ Section 21: Release Plan


🧭 Milestones
Stage
	Trigger
	Dev Complete
	All backend + UI flows working in Dev Repl

	UAT Ready
	PM and COO walk through hiring flow with real candidate data
	Prod Launch
	All prod .env values set + Replit Autoscale toggled on
	

🛠️ Cutover Types
Type
	Usage
	Full Cutover
	Default for MVP — replaces Airtable/Slack manual flow day one
	Staged Rollout
	Optional if adding new customer dashboard in Phase 2 (behind env flag)
	

✅ Section 22: Delivery Infrastructure Blueprint


Layer
	Stack
	Frontend
	Replit Autoscale Static Hosting (Next.js)
	Backend
	API routes in same Repl (Node + TypeScript)
	Worker Queue
	Replit Cron (time-based triggers), fallback to Make if >3 tool chain
	Email Sender
	Replit Email API → fallback: Resend or SendGrid
	Database
	Replit DB (K/V) → Supabase fallback
	Authentication
	JWT-based — signed tokens passed via query param or cookie for customer views
	Logging
	Replit Console for dev; optional Slack error alerts
	

✅ Fully Replit-native unless autoscale ceiling hit — modular fallback options already structured (Supabase, Resend, Reserved VM).

✅ Section 25: Tech Stack Decision Tree
Question
	Decision
	Does your app have a UI?
	✅ Yes → Use Next.js + TypeScript
	Is your logic reusable or multi-user?
	✅ Yes → Use TS + Replit DB (modularized)
	Does it require SSR or routing?
	✅ Yes → Use Next.js app router
	Is the workload memory-bound or time-sensitive?
	🚧 Potentially → Escalate to Reserved VM or multi-Repl split
	Will candidate or manager roles require login/auth?
	✅ Yes → Use JWT-based access tokens (no full auth system yet)
	Will the system grow to >1,000 records?
	✅ Yes → Build modular DB connector for Supabase fallback
	Are 3+ third-party tools required in a single workflow?
	⚠️ Yes → Escalate to Make.com fallback only if Cron breaks
