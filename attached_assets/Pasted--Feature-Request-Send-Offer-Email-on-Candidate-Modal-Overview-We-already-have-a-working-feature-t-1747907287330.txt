📨 Feature Request: Send Offer Email on Candidate Modal
Overview
We already have a working feature that sends an interview email when the “Interview” button is pressed and the candidate's Current Status is set to “45 1st Interview Sent”. I want to replicate this pattern for sending offer emails — with a few important differences.

✅ New Feature: Send Offer Email
Trigger Conditions
The email should be triggered instantly (no delay) when any of the following three elements are interacted with:

The Current Status dropdown is set to Offer.

The Final Decision Status dropdown is set to Offer.

The yellow Offer button is pressed.

⚠️ Regardless of which one is used, the same logic applies.

What Should Happen
Immediately send the offer email to the candidate’s email address (from the database).

Update the candidate’s status in the system to offersent.

DO NOT log this email into the notification_queue table.

The email should send asynchronously and instantly (without waiting for the modal to close or Save button).

Replace [Candidate Name] with the actual full name from the candidate record.

You may hardcode the subject and body format, just make [Candidate Name] dynamic.

💡 Notes
Follow the same architecture used in the current “Interview” email feature.

You can reuse the email-sending utility if one exists, just make sure not to queue it.

Ensure there's no delay — pressing any of the triggers should immediately fire off the email.
